# OOP Assignments Repository

This repository was created as part of an assignment given in the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) class at Vilnius University. The primary programming language used for the course is PHP.

## Assignments

1. **Collatz Conjecture Generator** (Main Branch)
   - This assignment focused on implementing a procedural generator that produces the Collatz Conjecture sequence.
   - The solution for this assignment can be found in the `main` branch.

2. **Access Modifiers** (Branch: `accessModifiers`)
   - The second assignment required adding an additional method to display the Collatz Conjecture sequence with respect to a mathematical progression.
   - The solution for this assignment can be found in the `accessModifiers` branch.

3. **Inheritance and Histogram** (Branch: `inheritance`)
   - The third assignment involved creating a child object with an additional method that produces a histogram based on the result of the Collatz Conjecture.
   - The solution for this assignment can be found in the `inheritance` branch.

Feel free to explore the respective branches to access the solutions for each assignment.
